# DeathLocation
A version of PlayerDeathLocation by Yupie that has been modified, along with its most noticeable bug fixed, for a server for a private community.

The original project can be seen at: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/playerdeathlocation.2483/

Due to years of being abandoned, we had taken it upon ourselves to update and maintain it for our own use since 2019, but after finally fixing the config bug, have decided to release the modified source code to share with the wider community.
